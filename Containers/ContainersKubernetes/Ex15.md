# Exercise 15: Install Siege and Stress Your Application

In this exercise, you will install Siege and use it to stress your application, which can trigger automatic scaling in your Kubernetes cluster.

## 1. Install Siege

Install Siege on your EC2 instance using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install siege
```

## 2. Stress Your Application

Use Siege to stress your application and potentially trigger automatic scaling. Run the following command, adjusting the values as needed:

```bash
siege -c <number_of_concurrent_users> -t <time_in_seconds> http://<external_ip>:<node_port>
```

For example:

```bash
siege -c 10 -t 1M http://35.180.79.31:32745
```

This command simulates 10 concurrent users for 1 minute, putting load on your application.

## 3. Interpreting Siege Output

When you run the Siege command, you will receive an output that provides important metrics about the test. Here's a breakdown of key metrics:

- **Transactions:** 105,683 hits - Total number of requests sent to the server.
- **Availability:** 100.00% - All requests were successful; no errors occurred.
- **Elapsed Time:** 59.22 seconds - Duration of the load testing.
- **Data Transferred:** 5751.53 MB - Amount of data transferred during the test.
- **Transaction Rate:** 1784.58 trans/sec - Rate at which transactions were performed.
- **Throughput:** 97.12 MB/sec - Rate of data transfer.
- **Concurrency:** 8.90 - Average number of concurrent users during the test.
- **Successful Transactions:** 105,683 - All transactions were successful.
- **Failed Transactions:** 0 - No transactions failed.
- **Longest Transaction:** 0.24 seconds - Longest response time observed.
- **Shortest Transaction:** 0.00 seconds - Shortest response time observed.

By following this exercise, you can gauge how well your application handles load and whether your horizontal pod autoscaler responds as expected.

By completing this exercise, you have successfully installed Siege, tested the stress on your application, and learned how to interpret Siege output to evaluate your application's performance.
