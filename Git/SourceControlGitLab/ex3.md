## Pushing Code to GitLab Server

To push your code from your computer to a GitLab server, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Initialize Git**: If you haven't already, initialize Git in your project directory by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```shell
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Remote Repository**: Add the URL of your GitLab repository as a remote repository using the following command:
   ```shell
   git remote add origin <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitLab repository.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**: Stage the files you want to push to the server using the following command:
   ```shell
   git add .
   ```
   This command stages all the modified and new files. If you want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the filenames.

   After staging the files, commit your changes with a descriptive message using the following command:
   ```shell
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. **Push to GitLab**: Finally, push your code to the GitLab server using the following command:
   ```shell
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   If you are working on a branch other than `master`, replace `master` with the appropriate branch name.

   Git will prompt you for your GitLab username and password (or access token) to authenticate and authorize the push.

   After successfully pushing the code, it will be available on your GitLab server.

**Note**: Ensure you have proper permissions and access rights to the GitLab repository to perform these actions.
