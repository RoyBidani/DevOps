## Set Up the AWS CodeCommit Repository

1. Create a new AWS CodeCommit repository for your Python weather application.
2. Note down the repository URL.

## Push the Source Code to CodeCommit Repository

3. Clone your Python weather application code to your local machine if you haven't already.
4. Use the AWS CLI to push the code to the CodeCommit repository:

```bash
cd path/to/your/weather/app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Create IAM HTTPS Git Credentials for CodeCommit

5. Configure IAM HTTPS Git credentials to authenticate with CodeCommit.

## Create "buildspec.yml" File

6. In the root directory of your Python weather application, create a file named "buildspec.yml". This file will define the build commands for AWS CodeBuild.

7. Add the following content to the "buildspec.yml" file:

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
  build:
    commands:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  name: my-python-weather-app
```

## Push Source Code to CodeCommit Repository

8. Commit your Python weather application source code to the CodeCommit repository.
9. Push the code to the CodeCommit repository using the CLI.

## Create an EC2 Instance

10. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS that will be used for deployment.
11. Ensure that the instance has the required IAM role and permissions to interact with AWS CodeDeploy.

## Create IAM Role for CodeDeploy

12. Create an IAM role for CodeDeploy with the necessary permissions.

## Create AWS CodeBuild Project

13. Go to the AWS CodeBuild service in the AWS Management Console.
14. Click on "Create build project."
15. Configure the CodeBuild project with the necessary settings for your Python app.

## Set Up AWS CodeDeploy

16. Create an AWS CodeDeploy application and deployment group.
17. Associate the EC2 instance you created earlier with the deployment group.

## Create AWS CodePipeline

18. Go to the AWS CodePipeline service in the AWS Management Console.
19. Click on "Create pipeline."
20. Configure the pipeline stages to use CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy as the source, build, and deployment providers, respectively.

## Test the Pipeline

21. Your pipeline should now be created and automatically start running.
22. CodePipeline will pull the source code from CodeCommit, build your Python web application using CodeBuild with the "buildspec.yml" file, and finally deploy the application using CodeDeploy on the EC2 instance.

Keep in mind that this pipeline configuration assumes you have already set up the necessary IAM roles and permissions for CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. Also, ensure that your EC2 instance has the required permissions to fetch your application code from CodeCommit during the deployment phase.
