### 1. Install and Configure Slack Plugin:
- If you haven't already, install the "Slack Notification" plugin in Jenkins. You can do this by going to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" tab and searching for "Slack Notification". Install the plugin and restart Jenkins if required.

### 2. Obtain Slack Workspace URL and Generate API Token

:
- Go to your Slack workspace and sign in as an administrator or owner.
- In the workspace settings, click on "Add apps" and search for "Jenkins".
- Add the Jenkins app to your Slack workspace.
- Once the Jenkins app is added, you will see a "Jenkins URL" provided by the app. This URL will be used as the Slack Workspace URL in Jenkins.

### 3. Create Slack Credentials in Jenkins:
- In Jenkins, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials" > "Jenkins" (or "Stores scoped to Jenkins") > "Global credentials (unrestricted)" > "Add Credentials".
- Choose "Secret text" as the kind.
- In the "Secret" field, paste the Slack API token you obtained from the Jenkins app integration in the Slack workspace.
- In the "ID" field, give a meaningful name to your credentials (e.g., "slack-api-token").
- In the "Description" field, provide additional context if needed.
- Click "OK" to save the credentials.

### 4. Update Jenkins Pipeline with Slack Credentials:
In your Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile), you can now reference the Slack credentials you created earlier:

```groovy
environment {
    SLACK_TOKEN = credentials('5e42bce0-d155-4c41-876d-f08e1f986639')
    SLACK_CHANNEL_SUCCESS = '#succeeded-build'
    SLACK_CHANNEL_FAILURE = '#devops-alerts'
    DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('dockerhub')
    DOCKERHUB_USERNAME = 'roybidani'
    DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD = 'R14081998'
}

 post {
        always {
            // Send notifications to the appropriate Slack channel based on build status
            script {
                def slackToken = env.SLACK_TOKEN
                def succeededChannel = env.SLACK_CHANNEL_SUCCESS
                def failureChannel = env.SLACK_CHANNEL_FAILURE

                if (currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') {
                    slackSend(
                        color: 'good',
                        message: "Build #${currentBuild.number} succeeded!",
                        channel: succeededChannel,
                        token: 'D9GfovbeqEhk7PFNVCjRb9nl'
                    )
                } else {
                    slackSend(
                        color: 'danger',
                        message: "Build #${currentBuild.number} failed! Check the console output for details.",
                        channel: failureChannel,
                        token: 'D9GfovbeqEhk7PFNVCjRb9nl'
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Make sure to replace `'slack-api-token'` with the actual ID you used when creating the Slack credentials in Jenkins.

With this setup, Jenkins will use the Slack credentials with the specified ID to authenticate and send notifications to the configured Slack workspace.
